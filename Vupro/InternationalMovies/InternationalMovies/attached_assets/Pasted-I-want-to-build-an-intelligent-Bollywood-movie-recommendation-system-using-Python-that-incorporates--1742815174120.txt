I want to build an intelligent Bollywood movie recommendation system using Python that incorporates NLP, machine learning, and deep learning techniques, with a Streamlit-based user interface. The system should:

Data Requirements:

Work with Bollywood/Hindi cinema datasets (like TMDB 5000 Movies)

Handle movie metadata (title, year, genre, director, cast)

Process plot summaries/overviews for NLP analysis

Include user ratings when available

Recommendation Approaches:

Implement content-based filtering using:

NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT) on movie plots

Genre/director/cast similarity matching

Implement collaborative filtering (if user rating data exists)

Hybrid recommendation combining both approaches

Optionally include deep learning models (Neural Collaborative Filtering, etc.)

NLP Components:

Text preprocessing for Hindi/English movie plots

Sentiment analysis of reviews

Keyword extraction from plots

Semantic similarity between movie descriptions

Machine Learning Pipeline:

Feature engineering for movie attributes

Similarity metrics (cosine similarity, Jaccard index)

Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

Model training and evaluation

Streamlit UI Features:

Clean, intuitive interface with Bollywood theme

Movie selection dropdown

Multiple recommendation views (by plot, by cast, hybrid)

Movie details display (poster, info, trailer link)

User preference collection

Responsive design for mobile/desktop

Technical Requirements:

Python 3.8+ implementation

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, NLTK/spaCy, TensorFlow/PyTorch

Streamlit for UI

Option to deploy on Streamlit Cloud/Heroku

Deliverables:

Complete Python code with documentation

Pretrained models (pickle files)

Dataset preprocessing scripts

Deployment instructions

Performance metrics (precision@k, recall@k)

Bonus Features:

Multilingual support (Hindi/English)

Mood-based recommendations

"Bollywood era" filters (90s, 2000s, etc.)

Actor/director filmography exploration

Trending/recent releases section

Could you provide:

The complete system architecture

Step-by-step implementation guide

Code templates for key components

Best practices for Bollywood-specific recommendations

Performance optimization tips

Solutions for common challenges (cold start, data sparsity)
