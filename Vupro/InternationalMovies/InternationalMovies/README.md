## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Processing toolkit for text analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for recommendation engine
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **TMDB API**: For fetching real movie posters and data
- **Pillow**: Image processing

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A TMDB API key (get one for free at [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

## üîß Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bollywood-movie-recommender.git
   cd bollywood-movie-recommender
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLTK data**
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

4. **Set up your TMDB API key**
   
   Option 1: Environment variable (recommended)
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   set TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   export TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Option 2: Create a .env file
   ```
   # Create a file named .env in the root directory
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   *For this method, make sure to uncomment the dotenv loading code in utils.py*

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Select a movie from the dropdown menu
2. Adjust filters if desired (release year range, specific genres)
3. Choose a recommendation method:
   - Plot-based: Recommendations based on movie plot similarity
   - Metadata-based: Recommendations based on genres, directors, and cast
   - Hybrid: Combined approach for more balanced recommendations
4. View recommended movies with their posters
5. See similarity explanations for why each movie was recommended

## üìä How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Movie data is fetched from TMDB API, focusing on Bollywood movies
2. **Text Processing**: Movie plots are processed using NLP techniques (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization converts text to numerical features
4. **Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity measures how similar movies are to each other
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Top similar movies are recommended based on selected criteria
